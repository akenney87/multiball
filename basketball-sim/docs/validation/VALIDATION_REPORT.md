## 🚨 Critical Issues Requiring Tuning

### Points Per Game
- **Current:** 72.8
- **Target:** 112.5
- **Difference:** -39.7 (-35.3%)

**Recommended Actions:**
- Increase BaseRates for all shot types (3PT, midrange, layup, dunk)
- Verify possessions per game are ~100 (currently too low may indicate pace issues)
- Check if FT system is working (FT% showing 0.0 suggests FTs not being awarded)

### Fg Pct
- **Current:** 42.1
- **Target:** 46.5
- **Difference:** -4.4 (-9.5%)

**Recommended Actions:**
- Increase BaseRates slightly across all shot types

### Ft Pct
- **Current:** 0.0
- **Target:** 77.5
- **Difference:** -77.5 (-100.0%)


### Fg3A Per Game
- **Current:** 29.4
- **Target:** 36.0
- **Difference:** -6.6 (-18.3%)


### Fta Per Game
- **Current:** 0.0
- **Target:** 22.0
- **Difference:** -22.0 (-100.0%)


### Oreb Per Game
- **Current:** 12.7
- **Target:** 10.5
- **Difference:** +2.2 (+21.0%)


### Oreb Pct
- **Current:** 27.3
- **Target:** 24.0
- **Difference:** +3.3 (+13.8%)

**Recommended Actions:**
- Decrease OREB_BASE_RATE in rebounding.py (currently set to 0.14)

### Ast Per Game
- **Current:** 16.1
- **Target:** 26.0
- **Difference:** -9.9 (-38.1%)


### Stl Per Game
- **Current:** 0.0
- **Target:** 7.5
- **Difference:** -7.5 (-100.0%)


### Blk Per Game
- **Current:** 0.0
- **Target:** 4.5
- **Difference:** -4.5 (-100.0%)


### Pf Per Game
- **Current:** 0.0
- **Target:** 20.0
- **Difference:** -20.0 (-100.0%)


### Possessions Per Game
- **Current:** 61.7
- **Target:** 100.0
- **Difference:** -38.3 (-38.3%)

**Recommended Actions:**
- Increase pace multipliers (fast/standard/slow)
- Check turnover rates (too many turnovers reduce possessions)
- Verify shot clock is functioning correctly

## ⚠️ Metrics Needing Minor Adjustment

- **Fg3 Pct:** 34.7 (target: 36.5)
- **Reb Per Game:** 46.9 (target: 44.0)

## Overall Assessment

❌ **REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT TUNING:** Multiple metrics are outside acceptable ranges.

**Recommendation:** Systematic tuning pass required. Address critical issues first (points, possessions), then re-validate.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Address Critical Failures:**
   - Fix points per game
   - Fix fg pct
   - Fix ft pct

2. **Re-run Validation:** Generate 20 new games to verify tuning

3. **Iterate:** Repeat tuning/validation cycle until all metrics PASS
