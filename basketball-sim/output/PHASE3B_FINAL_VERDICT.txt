PHASE 3B FINAL VERDICT - EXPONENTIAL PENALTY FAILED
================================================================================

IMPLEMENTATION:
  - Applied exponential penalty: (creation / 100) ** 1.5
  - Hassan (67.3): 0.552 weight (82.0% of linear)
  - Chris (83.1): 0.758 weight (91.2% of linear)
  - Created 28% differentiation vs 19% with linear

RESULTS:
  - Rim attempts: 44.9% -> 45.9% (+1.0%) INCREASED!
  - Midrange: 13.6% -> 12.7% (-0.9%)
  - 3PT: 41.5% -> 41.4% (-0.1%)

VERDICT: Exponential penalty also had MINIMAL/NEGATIVE impact.

================================================================================
ROOT CAUSE: USAGE DISTRIBUTION CANNOT SOLVE SHOT SELECTION
================================================================================

We've now tested THREE approaches to usage distribution:
1. Versatility-based (Phase 3 attempt 1): Rim 44.9% -> 46.8% WORSE
2. Shot creation linear (Phase 3 attempt 2): Rim 44.9% -> 44.8% NO CHANGE
3. Shot creation exponential (Phase 3b): Rim 44.9% -> 45.9% WORSE

ALL THREE FAILED to reduce rim attempts significantly.

WHY THEY ALL FAILED:

Problem: Even with aggressive usage reduction, rim-heavy players who GAIN usage
also attack the rim.

Example from Phase 3b:
  - Hassan (67.3 creation, 0.552 weight): Lost usage
  - Jerry (80.9 creation, 0.727 weight): Gained usage
  - Vince (77.3 creation, 0.679 weight): Gained usage

But Jerry and Vince are ALSO rim-heavy:
  - Jerry: 72.5 rim composite -> Takes 60%+ at rim
  - Vince: 81.5 rim composite -> Takes 70%+ at rim

NET EFFECT: Trading Hassan's rim attempts for Jerry/Vince's rim attempts.
No net reduction.

THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE:
  Usage distribution controls WHO gets the ball.
  Shot selection (composite bonuses) controls WHAT SHOTS they take.

  We can't fix "what shots" by changing "who gets ball" when everyone
  takes high % of shots at rim.

================================================================================
THE ARCHITECTURE IS STILL CORRECT
================================================================================

Despite the failure to reduce rim attempts, shot creation system is NOT wrong:

1. IT'S NBA-REALISTIC:
   - Hassan (67.3) should get less usage than Chris (83.1)
   - Traditional centers don't create offense in NBA
   - This matches real basketball

2. IT WILL HELP FUTURE SYSTEMS:
   - Assist attribution (playmakers create more assists)
   - Turnover rates (ball handlers turn it over more)
   - Drive-and-kick sequences
   - Offensive role differentiation

3. IT'S ATTRIBUTE-DRIVEN:
   - Uses deception, hand-eye, agility (ball handling)
   - Uses awareness, creativity, patience, composure (playmaking)
   - Aligns with Pillar 3: Attribute-Driven Outcomes

CONCLUSION: Shot creation usage is CORRECT but INSUFFICIENT for rim problem.

================================================================================
THE REAL PROBLEM: COMPOSITE BONUSES
================================================================================

Current system (shooting.py:191):
```python
if composite_diff_rim >= 0:
    rim_bonus = composite_diff_rim * 0.008  # Up to +32% at composite=90
```

This makes EVERYONE attack rim too much:
  - Hassan (77.7 rim): 90% at rim (realistic)
  - Vince (81.5 rim): 75% at rim (too high)
  - Marcus (78.0 rim): 75% at rim (too high)
  - Jerry (72.5 rim): 60% at rim (too high for a "midrange" specialist)
  - Even Ray Sniper (70.5 rim): 55% at rim (too high for a pure shooter)

EVERYONE with composite >70 takes majority of shots at rim.

This is the problem. Not usage.

================================================================================
FINAL RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

VERDICT: We must address shot SELECTION, not just usage distribution.

RECOMMENDED APPROACH: COMBINED SOLUTION

KEEP:
  - Shot creation usage system (Phase 3b with exponential penalty)
  - Rationale: Architecturally correct, helps future systems, NBA-realistic

ADD:
  - Reduce composite bonus multiplier (shooting.py:191)
  - Change: rim_bonus = composite_diff_rim * 0.008
  - To: rim_bonus = composite_diff_rim * 0.005 (or even 0.004)
  - This directly reduces rim shot selection for ALL players

EXPECTED COMBINED IMPACT:
  - Shot creation: Hassan gets less ball (architecturally correct)
  - Composite reduction: Hassan STILL takes 90% at rim (realistic)
                         But Jerry takes 45% at rim (down from 60%)
                         And Vince takes 55% at rim (down from 75%)
                         And Marcus takes 60% at rim (down from 75%)

  - Net effect: Rim 45.9% -> 38-42% (6-8% reduction)

ALTERNATIVE: More aggressive approaches if combined doesn't work
  - Option A: Reduce multiplier to 0.003 (even more aggressive)
  - Option B: Add floor to rim distribution (can't go below 25% rim)
  - Option C: Add ceiling to rim distribution (can't exceed 70% rim)

TIME TO IMPLEMENT: 5 minutes + 3 minutes test = 8 minutes

================================================================================
USER DECISION NEEDED
================================================================================

We've proven usage distribution alone cannot solve the problem.
We must address shot selection mechanics.

OPTIONS:

A) Implement combined approach (shot creation + composite reduction)
   - Keeps shot creation system (correct architecture)
   - Adds composite reduction (solves rim problem)
   - Expected: Rim 45.9% -> 38-42%

B) Abandon usage approach, only do composite reduction
   - Simpler, but loses architectural benefit
   - Expected: Rim 45.9% -> 40-43%

C) Try even more aggressive exponential penalty (^2.0 or ^2.5)
   - May create unrealistic usage distribution
   - Unlikely to solve problem based on analysis

D) Accept current state and move to other tuning
   - Keep rim at 45-46% (10% above NBA)
   - Focus on midrange/FG%/PPG instead

MY RECOMMENDATION: Option A (combined approach)

This preserves the correct architecture while solving the actual problem.
