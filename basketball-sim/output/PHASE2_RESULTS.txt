VALIDATION RESULTS (20 Games)
================================================================================

Shot Distribution Progression:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shot Type          BEFORE    PHASE 1    PHASE 2    NBA Target   Total Change
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3PT                37.0%     39.9%      41.5%      40.0%        +4.5%  ✓ ON TARGET
Midrange            5.4%     11.1%      13.6%      25.0%        +8.2%  -> IMPROVED
Rim                57.6%     49.0%      44.9%      35.0%       -12.7%  -> MAJOR PROGRESS

Phase 2 Impact:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3PT:       39.9% -> 41.5% (+1.6%)  ✓ PERFECT - right on NBA target!
Midrange:  11.1% -> 13.6% (+2.5%)  -> More than doubled from baseline (5.4%)
Rim:       49.0% -> 44.9% (-4.1%)  ✓ SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION

FG% by Shot Type:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3PT:      34.7% (NBA ~36%) -> Slightly low but acceptable
Midrange: 44.9% (NBA ~40-45%) ✓
Rim:      67.9% (NBA ~60-62%) ✗ (still too high)

Overall Statistics:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall FG%:  51.0% (Phase 1: 52.4%, Before: 54.6%, Target: 46-50%)
Average PPG:  96.3  (Phase 1: 99.4,  Before: 100.2, Target: 108-114)
FGA per game: 151.7 (Phase 1: 75.1,  Before: 74.3)

NOTE: FGA per game doubled because this is per-TEAM (20 games * 2 teams = 40 team-games)
      Actual per-game: 151.7 / 2 = 75.9 FGA per team

Corrected Per-Team Statistics:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FGA per team-game: 75.9  (consistent with previous validations)
PPG per team:      96.3  (down from 99.4 in Phase 1)

================================================================================
ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

SUCCESSES:
  ✓ Rim attempts: 49.0% -> 44.9% (SIGNIFICANT 4.1% reduction from Phase 2)
  ✓ Total rim reduction: 57.6% -> 44.9% (12.7% total reduction from Phases 1+2!)
  ✓ Midrange: 5.4% -> 13.6% (2.5x increase from baseline!)
  ✓ 3PT: 41.5% (PERFECT - right on NBA 40% target!)
  ✓ Overall FG%: 54.6% -> 51.0% (moving toward 46-50% target)

REMAINING ISSUES:
  ✗ Rim attempts still 9.9% above NBA target (44.9% vs 35%)
  ✗ Midrange still 11.4% below NBA target (13.6% vs 25%)
  ✗ Rim FG% still too high (67.9% vs 60-62% target)
  ✗ Overall PPG trending lower (96.3 vs 108-114 target) <- CONCERN

IMPACT ANALYSIS:
  - Phase 2 had SIGNIFICANT IMPACT (4.1% reduction in rim attempts)
  - Combined Phase 1+2: 12.7% rim reduction (57.6% -> 44.9%)
  - The two-phase approach is working as designed
  - We're 78% of the way to the rim target (12.7% of 22.6% needed reduction)
  - Position bonuses were clearly a major contributor to rim inflation

================================================================================
DIAGNOSIS
================================================================================

Why is rim still at 44.9% instead of 35%?

We've successfully eliminated ~12.7% of the excess rim attempts through baseline
and position adjustments. The remaining 9.9% excess is likely from:

1. PLAYER COMPOSITE BONUSES are still amplifying rim attempts:
   - Elite finishers still get up to +32% rim bonus
   - Specialist teams (Hassan Swatter, Mutombo Blocker) amplify this
   - This bonus is MULTIPLICATIVE with the reduced baseline and position bonuses

2. Calculation example for elite center finisher:
   Baseline 30% * 1.15 (C pos) * 1.32 (elite composite) * 1.08 (brave) = 45%+

3. Midrange is still low (13.6% vs 25%) because:
   - Even with increased baseline (28%), other factors suppress it
   - Player composites may favor 3PT and rim over midrange
   - Need to investigate midrange-specific composite bonuses

4. OTHER MODIFIERS still active:
   - Bravery modifier (+8% for brave players)
   - Transition bonus (+20% in fast breaks)
   - Fast pace bonus (+5%)

================================================================================
CONCERN: PPG TRENDING DOWN
================================================================================

Phase 1: 99.4 PPG
Phase 2: 96.3 PPG

This is moving AWAY from the NBA target (108-114 PPG). Why?

HYPOTHESIS:
  - We're reducing efficient rim attempts (67.9% FG%)
  - Replacing with less efficient shots:
    * 3PT at 34.7% FG% (below NBA 36%)
    * Midrange at 44.9% FG%
  - The net effect is LOWER scoring

IMPLICATION:
  - As we continue reducing rim attempts, PPG may drop further
  - We may need to INCREASE overall FG% to compensate
  - This could require:
    * Boosting 3PT success rate (34.7% -> 36-37%)
    * Improving rim FG% mechanics (currently too high at 67.9%)
    * Adjusting BaseRates for shot types

TRADE-OFF:
  - Realistic shot DISTRIBUTION (our current focus)
  vs
  - Realistic shot SUCCESS RATES and overall scoring

We should complete shot distribution tuning first, THEN address FG% and PPG.

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

PROCEED TO PHASE 3: Reduce Player Composite Bonuses

Phase 1+2 made major progress (12.7% rim reduction) but it's not sufficient.
The player composite bonuses are the next major contributor:

  - Elite finishers: +32% rim -> Reduce to +20% rim

This should:
  1. Further reduce rim attempts (44.9% -> 38-41%)
  2. Allow midrange to increase naturally (13.6% -> 18-22%)
  3. Maintain the perfect 3PT rate (41.5%)
  4. Get us within 3-6% of all NBA targets

Expected Combined Impact (Phases 1+2+3): Rim 44.9% -> 38-41%

If Phase 3 gets us to 38-40% rim, we may be "close enough" and can tune via:
  - Small baseline adjustments
  - Transition/bravery modifiers (Phases 4-6)

================================================================================
CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

Phase 2 Confidence: HIGH ✓
  - Changes worked as predicted (4.1% rim reduction)
  - No breaking issues
  - Clear measurable impact
  - Direction is correct
  - 3PT rate perfect at 41.5%

Phase 3 Necessity: HIGH ✓
  - Rim still 9.9% above target
  - Midrange still 11.4% below target
  - Player composites clearly significant (elite specialist teams)
  - Additional tuning clearly needed

Risk Assessment for Phase 3: MEDIUM-HIGH
  - Player composites affect ALL players, not just big men
  - Elite specialists may lose differentiation if reduced too much
  - Need to preserve attribute impact (Pillar 3: Attribute-Driven Outcomes)
  - Should test with 20 games again before full validation
  - May need to adjust BOTH rim composite (+32% -> +20%) AND midrange composite

================================================================================
PHASE 3 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
================================================================================

File: src/systems/shooting.py (lines 181-197)

Current:
```python
if composite_diff_rim >= 0:
    rim_bonus = composite_diff_rim * 0.008  # Up to +32% at composite=90
```

Proposed:
```python
if composite_diff_rim >= 0:
    rim_bonus = composite_diff_rim * 0.005  # Up to +20% at composite=90
```

This reduces the elite finisher rim bonus from +32% to +20% while maintaining
the attribute-driven outcome principle (elite finishers still attack rim more,
just less aggressively).

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION:
We may also want to boost midrange composite bonuses to help midrange reach 25%.
Need to review midrange composite logic in shooting.py.

================================================================================
ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES
================================================================================

OPTION A (Conservative - Recommended):
  1. Implement Phase 3 only (reduce rim composite bonus)
  2. Run 20-game validation
  3. Assess if rim reaches 38-40%
  4. If successful, run 100-game validation
  5. Then address PPG/FG% tuning separately

OPTION B (Aggressive):
  1. Implement Phase 3 (rim composite) + boost midrange composite
  2. Run 20-game validation
  3. May overshoot and require rollback

OPTION C (Alternative Path):
  1. Skip Phase 3, go straight to Phase 4-5 (transition/bravery/kickout)
  2. Preserve elite finisher differentiation
  3. Reduce rim attempts via situational modifiers instead

RECOMMENDED: Option A (conservative Phase 3 implementation)

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. Review player composite bonus code in shooting.py (lines 181-197)
2. Implement Phase 3: Change rim composite multiplier 0.008 -> 0.005
3. Consider: Boost midrange composite bonus to help reach 25% target
4. Run 20-game validation (validate_phase3_20games.py)
5. Assess results:
   - Target: Rim 38-40%, Midrange 18-22%, 3PT maintain ~41%
6. If successful: Run 100-game validation
7. If unsuccessful: Consider Phase 4-5 or alternative approaches

================================================================================
