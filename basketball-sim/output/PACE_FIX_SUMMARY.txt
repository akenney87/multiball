PACE TACTICAL FIX SUMMARY - M4.6 UPDATE
================================================================================

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
  Pace settings were producing only ~5% possession differences instead of the
  specified +/-10-15% required by basketball_sim.md specification.

ROOT CAUSE:
  Possession duration differences were too small:
    - FAST: 13.7s (4.9% shorter than STANDARD)
    - STANDARD: 14.4s (baseline)
    - SLOW: 15.2s (5.6% longer than STANDARD)

FIX APPLIED (src/systems/game_clock.py):
  Updated possession duration calculations to increase pace differentiation:
    - FAST: 12.8s avg (range 7.7-17.9s) → ~113 poss/team/game
    - STANDARD: 14.4s avg (range 8.6-20.2s) → ~100 poss/team/game
    - SLOW: 16.5s avg (range 9.9-23.1s) → ~87 poss/team/game

VALIDATION RESULTS (150 games - 50 per pace setting):

  BEFORE FIX:
    - FAST vs STANDARD: +5.2% possessions [FAIL]
    - SLOW vs STANDARD: -4.8% possessions [FAIL]
    - FAST vs SLOW: +10.5% possessions [FAIL]
    - Status: All tests FAILED

  AFTER FIX:
    - FAST vs STANDARD: +12.2% possessions [PASS] ✓
    - SLOW vs STANDARD: -12.6% possessions [PASS] ✓
    - FAST vs SLOW: +28.3% possessions [PASS] ✓
    - Status: All tests PASSED ✓

DETAILED METRICS:

  FAST Pace:
    - Avg possessions per game: 226.5
    - Avg total points: 219.4
    - Avg FG%: 54.3%
    - Effect: +12.2% more possessions than STANDARD

  STANDARD Pace:
    - Avg possessions per game: 201.9
    - Avg total points: 197.3
    - Avg FG%: 53.5%
    - Effect: Baseline (target ~100 possessions/team)

  SLOW Pace:
    - Avg possessions per game: 176.5
    - Avg total points: 178.4
    - Avg FG%: 53.3%
    - Effect: -12.6% fewer possessions than STANDARD

IMPACT:
  - Core Pillar #4 (Tactical Input System) now properly validated
  - Pace setting is now a meaningful tactical decision
  - FAST pace creates faster, higher-scoring games
  - SLOW pace creates grind-it-out, lower-scoring games
  - ~28% possession difference between FAST and SLOW creates distinct playstyles

FILES MODIFIED:
  - src/systems/game_clock.py (lines 42-121)
    - calculate_possession_duration() function
    - estimate_possessions_per_quarter() function
    - Updated documentation with M4.6 tuning notes

FILES CREATED:
  - output/PACE_DIAGNOSIS.txt (root cause analysis)
  - output/PACE_VALIDATION.txt (validation results)
  - output/PACE_FIX_SUMMARY.txt (this file)
  - validate_pace_tactical.py (validation script)

NEXT STEPS:
  1. Validate man/zone defense tactical system
  2. Validate scoring options tactical system
  3. Re-test team rating correlation (may improve with functional tactics)
  4. Validate rebounding strategy tactical system

SEVERITY: CRITICAL → RESOLVED ✓
  This was a SEVERITY 1 issue (PM agent classification)
  Fix verified through 150-game validation suite
  Pace tactical system now meets specification
