PACE TACTICAL VALIDATION: ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

VALIDATION TEST RESULTS:
  - FAST vs STANDARD: +5.2% possessions (expected +10% to +15%)
  - SLOW vs STANDARD: -4.8% possessions (expected -10% to -15%)
  - FAST vs SLOW: +10.5% possessions (expected +18% to +35%)
  - STATUS: [FAIL] All tests failed

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
  The pace implementation is internally consistent but uses possession durations
  that are too similar to produce the specified possession count differences.

CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION (src/systems/game_clock.py lines 72-80):
  FAST pace: 13.7s avg possession duration
  STANDARD pace: 14.4s avg possession duration
  SLOW pace: 15.2s avg possession duration

MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS:
  Percentage difference in duration:
    - FAST vs STANDARD: (14.4 - 13.7) / 14.4 = 4.9% shorter
    - SLOW vs STANDARD: (15.2 - 14.4) / 14.4 = 5.6% longer

  Expected possession count difference:
    - If duration is X% shorter → possessions are ~X% higher
    - 4.9% shorter duration → ~4.9% more possessions
    - 5.6% longer duration → ~5.3% fewer possessions

  This EXACTLY matches validation results:
    - Expected: ~4.9% → Observed: +5.2% ✓
    - Expected: ~5.3% → Observed: -4.8% ✓

SPECIFICATION REQUIREMENT (basketball_sim.md):
  FAST pace: +10% to +15% more possessions than STANDARD
  SLOW pace: -10% to -15% fewer possessions than STANDARD

TARGET POSSESSION DURATIONS TO MEET SPEC:
  STANDARD pace: 14.4s (keep as-is, targeting ~100 poss/team/game)

  FAST pace:
    - Target: +10% to +15% more possessions
    - Duration calculation: 14.4 / 1.125 (midpoint of 1.10-1.15) = 12.8s
    - Suggested: 12.8s avg (range 7.7-17.9s)

  SLOW pace:
    - Target: -10% to -15% fewer possessions
    - Duration calculation: 14.4 / 0.875 (midpoint of 0.85-0.90) = 16.5s
    - Suggested: 16.5s avg (range 9.9-23.1s)

VERIFICATION OF SUGGESTED DURATIONS:
  FAST: 720s / 12.8s = 56.3 possessions/quarter → ~225 per game (both teams)
  STANDARD: 720s / 14.4s = 50.0 possessions/quarter → ~200 per game
  SLOW: 720s / 16.5s = 43.6 possessions/quarter → ~174 per game

  FAST vs STANDARD: (56.3 - 50.0) / 50.0 = +12.6% ✓
  SLOW vs STANDARD: (43.6 - 50.0) / 50.0 = -12.8% ✓

RECOMMENDED FIX:
  Update src/systems/game_clock.py lines 72-80:

  if pace == 'fast':
      # Fast pace: 7.7-17.9s, mode 12.8s → ~113 possessions/team/game (+12.5%)
      duration = random.triangular(7.7, 17.9, 12.8)
  elif pace == 'standard':
      # Standard pace: 8.6-20.2s, mode 14.4s → ~100 possessions/team/game
      duration = random.triangular(8.6, 20.2, 14.4)
  elif pace == 'slow':
      # Slow pace: 9.9-23.1s, mode 16.5s → ~87 possessions/team/game (-12.5%)
      duration = random.triangular(9.9, 23.1, 16.5)

  Also update estimate_possessions_per_quarter() function (lines 115-120):

  if pace == 'fast':
      avg_duration = 12.8  # Updated for +12.5% possessions
  elif pace == 'standard':
      avg_duration = 14.4  # Keep as-is
  elif pace == 'slow':
      avg_duration = 16.5  # Updated for -12.5% possessions

IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
  - This change will make pace a more meaningful tactical decision
  - FAST pace games will have ~13% more possessions (faster, higher scoring)
  - SLOW pace games will have ~13% fewer possessions (grind-it-out style)
  - Stamina drain modifiers already in place (FAST: +15%, SLOW: -15%)
  - Should improve team rating correlation by making tactics more impactful

SEVERITY: CRITICAL (Pillar #4 violation)
  Core Pillar #4: "Tactical Input System - User strategy influences outcomes"
  Current implementation: Pace has only ~50% of intended effect
  User expectation: Setting FAST pace should noticeably increase game tempo

NEXT STEPS:
  1. Apply recommended fix to src/systems/game_clock.py
  2. Re-run pace validation test
  3. Verify possession counts meet +10-15% / -10-15% targets
  4. Proceed to man/zone defense tactical validation
