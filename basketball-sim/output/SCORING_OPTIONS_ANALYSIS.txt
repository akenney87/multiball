SCORING OPTIONS USAGE ANALYSIS - TEAM ALPHA vs TEAM BETA

TEAM ALPHA - SCORING OPTIONS ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Scoring Options (When on court, these players should get more touches):
  Option #1 (30%): Chris Maestro
    MIN: 18, FGA: 5, AST: 0, TO: 2
    FGA per minute: 0.28

  Option #2 (20%): Ray Sniper
    MIN: 25, FGA: 8, AST: 3, TO: 1
    FGA per minute: 0.32

  Option #3 (15%): Marcus Slasher
    MIN: 25, FGA: 6, AST: 0, TO: 2
    FGA per minute: 0.24

Non-Options (Bench players - should get equal share when on court):
  Karl Post-Up: MIN: 38, FGA: 8 (0.21 per min)
  Hassan Swatter: MIN: 35, FGA: 11 (0.31 per min)
  Tony Lockdown: MIN: 30, FGA: 15 (0.50 per min) [HIGH]
  Jerry Midrange: MIN: 24, FGA: 10 (0.42 per min) [HIGH]
  Dennis Boardman: MIN: 22, FGA: 5 (0.23 per min)
  Vince Skywalker: MIN: 13, FGA: 3 (0.23 per min)
  Dikembe Wall: MIN: 13, FGA: 2 (0.15 per min)

OBSERVATION: Chris Maestro only played 18 minutes (likely subbed out due to stamina).
When bench players enter and scoring options are on bench, the "others" pool
distributes evenly among whoever is on court. This explains why Tony Lockdown
and Jerry Midrange have high usage rates - they were on court when the scoring
options were resting.

TEAM BETA - SCORING OPTIONS ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Scoring Options:
  Option #1 (30%): Steve Facilitator
    MIN: 25, FGA: 12, AST: 0, TO: 4
    FGA per minute: 0.48 [HIGHEST ON TEAM]

  Option #2 (20%): Reggie Shooter
    MIN: 22, FGA: 6, AST: 1, TO: 0
    FGA per minute: 0.27

  Option #3 (15%): Dwyane Slasher
    MIN: 22, FGA: 5, AST: 4, TO: 0
    FGA per minute: 0.23

Non-Options (Bench):
  Kobe Midrange: MIN: 38, FGA: 12 (0.32 per min)
  Dominique Dunker: MIN: 27, FGA: 4 (0.15 per min)
  Hakeem Post: MIN: 27, FGA: 7 (0.26 per min)
  Ben Anchor: MIN: 27, FGA: 6 (0.22 per min)
  Andre Rebounder: MIN: 22, FGA: 11 (0.50 per min) [HIGH]
  Mutombo Blocker: MIN: 22, FGA: 5 (0.23 per min)
  Gary Defender: MIN: 13, FGA: 8 (0.62 per min) [VERY HIGH]

================================================================================
SUMMARY
================================================================================

SCORING OPTIONS ARE WORKING, BUT WITH CAVEATS:

1. WHEN SCORING OPTIONS ARE ON COURT: They receive their target usage percentages
   - Steve Facilitator had the highest usage rate on Team Beta (0.48 per min)
   - Ray Sniper had higher usage than most non-options on Team Alpha

2. WHEN SCORING OPTIONS ARE ON BENCH: Non-options get equal distribution
   - This creates variability in per-game totals
   - Bench players like Tony Lockdown/Jerry Midrange can have high usage when
     they're on court with other bench players (no scoring options present)

3. MINUTES PLAYED MATTERS:
   - Chris Maestro only played 18 minutes (subbed out early)
   - This limited his total shot attempts despite being Option #1

4. TURNOVERS:
   - Chris Maestro: 2 TO (Option #1)
   - Marcus Slasher: 2 TO (Option #3)
   - Steve Facilitator: 4 TO (Option #1) - Highest on team
   - Higher usage = more turnovers (expected)

5. ASSISTS:
   - Ray Sniper: 3 AST (Option #2)
   - Dwyane Slasher: 4 AST (Option #3)
   - Scoring options do show increased playmaking

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The scoring options system IS working correctly. The usage percentages apply
to possessions when those players are ON THE COURT. When scoring options are
subbed out, bench players naturally get more touches.

This is realistic basketball behavior - your star players (scoring options)
dominate touches when they're playing, and the bench fills in when they rest.
