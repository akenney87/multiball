SIGMOID K=0.025 RESULTS ANALYSIS - UNEXPECTED REGRESSION
================================================================================

COMPARISON: k=0.015 vs k=0.025 (Both 100 games)

================================================================================
CORRELATION (PRIMARY METRIC)
================================================================================

k=0.015:  r = 0.054
k=0.025:  r = 0.049  ← WORSE (9% degradation)

Expected: r = 0.25-0.30 (5x improvement)
Actual:   r = 0.049 (9% degradation)

**STATUS: CRITICAL FAILURE**

================================================================================
OVERALL 3PT% 
================================================================================

k=0.015:  25.4%
k=0.025:  27.0%  (+1.6pp increase)

This makes sense: Higher k should boost elite shooters more than it hurts poor ones.

================================================================================
FG% BY COMPOSITE BUCKET
================================================================================

Composite   k=0.015   k=0.025   Delta
-------------------------------------------
40-50       21.1%     24.4%     +3.3pp
50-55       22.9%     24.1%     +1.2pp  ← INVERTED!
55-60       24.8%     25.2%     +0.4pp
60-65       27.4%     29.6%     +2.2pp
65-70       29.4%     30.2%     +0.8pp
70-80       26.2%     29.7%     +3.5pp  ← Was anomaly before

**CRITICAL ISSUE: 50-55 bucket (24.1%) < 40-50 bucket (24.4%)**

This is an INVERTED correlation - worse shooters outperforming better shooters!

================================================================================
SPREAD ANALYSIS
================================================================================

k=0.015 spread: 29.4% - 21.1% = 8.3pp
k=0.025 spread: 30.2% - 24.1% = 6.1pp

**EXPECTED**: Spread should INCREASE with higher k
**ACTUAL**: Spread DECREASED by 2.2pp (27% reduction)

This is the opposite of what should happen mathematically.

================================================================================
CONTEST DISTRIBUTION
================================================================================

Contest Level       k=0.015       k=0.025
-------------------------------------------------
Wide Open (6+ ft)   24.2% @ 33.8% FG%   24.1% @ 36.4% FG%
Contested (2-6 ft)  64.7% @ 23.8% FG%   64.4% @ 25.4% FG%
Heavy (<2 ft)       10.6% @ 16.2% FG%   11.0% @ 15.8% FG%

Contest distributions are nearly identical, so this isn't the cause.

================================================================================
HYPOTHESIS: WHY DID THIS HAPPEN?
================================================================================

Possible Explanations:

1. **Random Variance (Most Likely)**
   - Different teams were selected in each 100-game run
   - Small sample size for shot-level correlation (n=6,860)
   - Binomial variance in make/miss outcomes

2. **Floor Lifting Effect**
   - Higher k increased base success rate for ALL matchups
   - Poor shooters got a bigger ABSOLUTE boost than elite shooters
   - This compressed the spread instead of expanding it

3. **Matchup Distribution Changed**
   - Random team selection may have created different defender quality distributions
   - Elite shooters may have faced harder matchups in k=0.025 run

4. **Formula Interaction Bug**
   - k increase may be affecting defensive calculations unintentionally
   - Contest penalties may be interacting with k in unexpected ways

5. **Measurement Methodology**
   - Pearson correlation may not be the right metric for binary outcomes
   - Should use point-biserial correlation or logistic regression instead

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. **Use Fixed Seed for Both Runs**
   - Re-run k=0.015 and k=0.025 with seed=42
   - This eliminates random team selection variance
   - Enables true apples-to-apples comparison

2. **Investigate Inverted Bucket**
   - Why is 50-55 bucket lower than 40-50 bucket?
   - Check if this is statistical noise or systematic issue
   - May need larger sample size (200+ games)

3. **Consult Agents Again**
   - Present unexpected results to probability-systems-architect
   - Ask for mathematical explanation
   - Verify formula is correct

4. **Consider Alternative k Values**
   - Maybe 0.025 is wrong value for some reason
   - Try k=0.020 (more conservative)
   - Try k=0.030 (more aggressive)

5. **Check Formula Implementation**
   - Verify weighted_sigmoid_probability is implemented correctly
   - Ensure k is being used in the right place
   - Check for any bugs in the formula

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

DO NOT COMMIT k=0.025 YET.

This result is highly unexpected and contradicts mathematical predictions.
Need to:
1. Run controlled comparison with fixed seed
2. Investigate inverted correlation in 50-55 bucket
3. Consult with agents on unexpected behavior
4. Verify formula implementation is correct

The correlation getting WORSE suggests something is fundamentally wrong with
either our approach, our measurement, or our understanding of the system.
