CONTEST PENALTY ANALYSIS - ALL SHOT TYPES
================================================================================

## Current State After Option A

Shot Type          Contested    Heavy      Defender Modifier
----------------------------------------------------------------
3PT (UPDATED)      -0.048       -0.09      ±2.5% (0.0005)  ✓
Midrange Short     -0.08        -0.15      ±2.5% (0.0005)  ✗
Midrange Long      -0.08        -0.15      ±2.5% (0.0005)  ✗
Rim (layup/dunk)   -0.06        -0.12      ±2.5% (0.0005)  ✗

Note: Defender modifier was reduced globally (0.001 → 0.0005) ✓

PROBLEM ANALYSIS
================================================================================

3PT Correlation Results:
- BEFORE Option A: r = 0.276 (defensive washout)
- AFTER Option A:  r = 0.788 (excellent correlation)

Key Insight:
The same defensive washout issue that affected 3PT shots likely exists for 
midrange and rim shots, since they use:
1. Same defender modifier scale (now fixed globally)
2. HIGHER contest penalties than 3PT (after Option A)

Midrange penalties are 67% HIGHER than updated 3PT:
- Contested: -0.08 vs -0.048 (67% higher)
- Heavy: -0.15 vs -0.09 (67% higher)

Rim penalties are 25-33% HIGHER than updated 3PT:
- Contested: -0.06 vs -0.048 (25% higher)
- Heavy: -0.12 vs -0.09 (33% higher)

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED CHANGES (OPTION A PARITY)
================================================================================

Apply same -40% reduction to midrange and rim shots for consistency:

MIDRANGE (both short and long):
Current:  contested = -0.08,  heavy = -0.15
Proposed: contested = -0.048, heavy = -0.09  (-40% reduction)

RIM (layups and dunks):
Current:  contested = -0.06,  heavy = -0.12
Proposed: contested = -0.036, heavy = -0.072 (-40% reduction)

Rationale:
- Same defensive washout mechanism affects all shot types
- Contest sensitivity differences already built into base rates:
  * 3PT base: ~33% (most variance from contests matters more)
  * Midrange base: ~40-45% (moderate variance)
  * Rim base: ~70% (least variance, but still affected)
- Reducing penalties allows shooter skill to shine through for ALL shots

================================================================================
ALTERNATIVE: SHOT-TYPE-SPECIFIC REDUCTIONS
================================================================================

If we want to preserve contest sensitivity hierarchy:

3PT:      -40% reduction (DONE)           → -0.048 / -0.09
Midrange: -35% reduction (moderate)      → -0.052 / -0.098
Rim:      -30% reduction (less sensitive) → -0.042 / -0.084

This maintains relative contest sensitivity while reducing washout.

However, simpler approach is uniform -40% reduction across all shot types.

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

Apply uniform -40% reduction to midrange and rim shots to match 3PT fix.

This ensures:
✓ Shooter skill predicts performance for ALL shot types
✓ Consistent defensive balance across the board
✓ Simpler to understand and maintain
✓ Can fine-tune later if specific shot types need adjustment

Next steps:
1. Update midrange_short penalties: -0.08 → -0.048, -0.15 → -0.09
2. Update midrange_long penalties: -0.08 → -0.048, -0.15 → -0.09
3. Update rim penalties: -0.06 → -0.036, -0.12 → -0.072
4. Test with correlation analysis (optional but recommended)
