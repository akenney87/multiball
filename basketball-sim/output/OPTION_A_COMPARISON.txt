OPTION A DEFENSIVE REDUCTION - BEFORE/AFTER COMPARISON
================================================================================

## Changes Implemented

Contest Penalties (3PT):
- Contested (2-6 ft): -0.08 → -0.048 (-40% reduction)
- Heavy (<2 ft): -0.15 → -0.09 (-40% reduction)

Defender Modifier Scale:
- Was: (defender_comp - 50) × 0.001 = ±5% penalty
- Now: (defender_comp - 50) × 0.0005 = ±2.5% penalty (-50% reduction)

================================================================================
PLAYER-LEVEL CORRELATION RESULTS
================================================================================

BEFORE Option A:
- Correlation: 0.276 (MODERATE)
- Qualified players: 14 (30+ attempts)
- Total 3PT attempts: 513
- Total makes: 134 (26.1%)
- Spread: 19.7 percentage points
- Assessment: Below acceptable threshold, defensive washout confirmed

AFTER Option A:
- Correlation: 0.788 (EXCELLENT!)
- Qualified players: 5 (30+ attempts)
- Total 3PT attempts: 164
- Total makes: 47 (28.7%)
- Spread: 33.9 percentage points
- Assessment: Shooter skill now strongly predicts performance

Note: After sample has only 1 player per bucket (5 total), so variance is high

INTERPRETATION
================================================================================

POSITIVE OUTCOMES:
✓ Correlation improved from MODERATE (0.276) to EXCELLENT (0.788)
✓ Shooter skill signal is now clear and dominant
✓ Spread increased 72%, showing better differentiation
✓ Overall 3PT% increased slightly (+2.6pp)
✓ System interpretation: "working correctly"

CONCERNS:
⚠ Sample size dropped significantly (14 → 5 players)
⚠ Some bucket inversions still present (55-60 worse than 50-55)
⚠ High variance due to small sample (1 player per bucket)

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

Option A is HIGHLY EFFECTIVE at allowing shooter skill to shine through.

Next steps:
1. Run larger sample (200-300 games) to get more qualified players
2. Validate that correlation remains high (>0.60) with larger sample
3. Check if bucket inversions disappear with more data
4. Verify 3PT% averages stay in reasonable NBA range (30-38%)

If correlation remains >0.60 with larger sample:
→ Option A is VALIDATED and should be kept
→ Defensive factors are now properly balanced
→ Shot-level correlation of ~0.05-0.10 is EXPECTED variance
