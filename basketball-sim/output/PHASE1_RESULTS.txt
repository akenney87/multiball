VALIDATION RESULTS (20 Games)
================================================================================

Shot Distribution:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shot Type          BEFORE    AFTER    NBA Target   Change    Status
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3PT                37.0%     39.9%    40.0%        +2.9%     ✓ ON TARGET
Midrange            5.4%     11.1%    25.0%        +5.7%     → IMPROVED (still low)
Rim                57.6%     49.0%    35.0%        -8.6%     → IMPROVED (still high)

FG% by Shot Type:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3PT:      36.5% (NBA ~36%) ✓
Midrange: 48.2% (NBA ~40-45%) ✓
Rim:      66.4% (NBA ~60-62%) ✗ (still too high)

Overall Statistics:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall FG%:  52.4% (previous: 54.6%, target: 46-50%)
Average PPG:  99.4  (previous: 100.2, target: 108-114)
FGA per game: 75.1  (previous: 74.3)

ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

SUCCESSES:
  ✓ 3PT attempts: 37.0% -> 39.9% (PERFECT - within 0.1% of NBA target!)
  ✓ Rim attempts: 57.6% -> 49.0% (MAJOR IMPROVEMENT - 8.6% reduction)
  ✓ Midrange: 5.4% -> 11.1% (DOUBLED - moving in right direction)
  ✓ Overall FG% decreased from 54.6% -> 52.4% (moving toward 46-50% target)

REMAINING ISSUES:
  ✗ Rim attempts still 14% above NBA target (49.0% vs 35%)
  ✗ Midrange still 13.9% below NBA target (11.1% vs 25%)
  ✗ Rim FG% still too high (66.4% vs 60-62% target)
  ✗ Overall PPG still low (99.4 vs 108-114 target)

IMPACT ANALYSIS:
  - Phase 1 had SIGNIFICANT IMPACT (8.6% reduction in rim attempts)
  - The change worked as predicted: rim dropped, 3PT and midrange increased
  - However, the system is still overcompensating toward rim attempts
  - Position bonuses (+25% for centers) are likely still pushing rim too high

================================================================================
DIAGNOSIS
================================================================================

Why is rim still at 49% instead of 35%?

The baseline dropped from 40% to 30% (10% reduction), but the final distribution
only dropped from 57.6% to 49% (8.6% reduction). This means:

1. COMPOUNDING MODIFIERS are still amplifying rim attempts:
   - Position bonuses (Centers +25%, PFs +10%)
   - Player composite bonuses (elite finishers up to +32%)
   - Bravery modifier (+8% for brave players)
   - Transition bonus (+20% in fast breaks)
   - Fast pace bonus (+5%)

2. The NEW baseline (30%) is still being multiplied by all these modifiers:
   30% base * 1.25 (center) * 1.32 (elite finisher) * 1.08 (brave) = 53%+

3. Midrange is still too low (11.1% vs 25%) because:
   - Baseline of 28% is getting REDUCED by other modifiers
   - Position adjustments SUBTRACT from midrange to add to rim
   - Player composites favor 3PT and rim over midrange

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

PROCEED TO PHASE 2: Reduce Position Bonuses

Phase 1 alone is not sufficient. The position bonuses are too aggressive:
  - Centers: +25% rim -> Reduce to +15% rim
  - PFs: +10% rim -> Reduce to +5% rim

This should:
  1. Further reduce rim attempts (49% -> 42-44%)
  2. Allow midrange to increase naturally (11% -> 18-20%)
  3. Maintain the perfect 3PT rate (39.9%)

ALTERNATIVE: Run Phase 2-3 together for faster iteration
  - Phase 2: Position bonuses
  - Phase 3: Player composite bonuses

Expected Combined Impact: Rim 49% -> 38-40%

================================================================================
CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

Phase 1 Confidence: HIGH ✓
  - Changes worked as predicted
  - No breaking issues
  - Clear measurable impact
  - Direction is correct

Phase 2 Necessity: HIGH ✓
  - Rim still 14% above target
  - Midrange still 13.9% below target
  - Additional tuning clearly needed

Risk Assessment for Phase 2: MEDIUM
  - Position bonuses affect big men heavily
  - May need to balance midrange increases with position changes
  - Should test with 20 games again before full 100-game validation

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

OPTION A (Conservative):
  1. Implement Phase 2 only (position bonuses)
  2. Run 20-game validation
  3. Assess results
  4. Implement Phase 3 if needed

OPTION B (Aggressive):
  1. Implement Phase 2 + Phase 3 together
  2. Run 20-game validation
  3. Fine-tune if needed
  4. Run 100-game validation

OPTION C (Data-Driven):
  1. Run full 100-game validation with Phase 1 only
  2. Get more stable statistics
  3. Determine exact additional reduction needed
  4. Implement Phase 2-3 based on data

RECOMMENDED: Option A (implement Phase 2, test, iterate)
