FACTORS AFFECTING 3PT SHOT SUCCESS:

SHOOTER-SIDE:
1. Shooter composite (8 attributes: form_technique 25%, throw_accuracy 20%, finesse 15%, hand_eye_coord 12%, balance 10%, composure 8%, consistency 6%, agility 4%)
2. Shooter stamina degradation (if <80 stamina)

DEFENDER-SIDE:
3. Defender composite (8 attributes: agility 25%, reactions 20%, awareness 15%, top_speed 12%, hand_eye_coord 10%, determination 8%, jumping 6%, stamina 4%)
4. Defender stamina degradation (if <80 stamina)
5. Contest distance: base = 10 - (defender_comp/10) + gauss(0, 1.9)
6. Contest tier penalty: 0% (wide 6+ft), -8% (contested 2-6ft), -15% (heavy <2ft)
7. Defender modifier: (defender_comp - 50) × 0.001 = ±5% additional penalty
8. Zone defense: reduces defender modifier by 15%
9. Help defense rotations (if primary beaten)

SYSTEM:
10. Base rate: 33%
11. Sigmoid k: 0.025
12. Attribute differential: shooter_comp - defender_comp (capped ±40)
13. Transition bonus: +8%
14. Random dice roll (final make/miss)

KEY OBSERVATION:
- Defender quality affects outcome in 3 ways: contest distance, defender modifier, help defense
- Contest distance has high variance (σ=1.9 feet)
- Most shots are contested tier (~65%) with -8% penalty + defender modifier
